## What the app does

1. **National Trends Over Time**: ‘Data’ mode displays both forecasted and actual carbon intensity values across the UK over a selected period. This allows users to observe and compare predicted environmental impacts against real outcomes, enhancing understanding of trends and deviations.
2. **Aggregate Data Analysis**: Users can explore aggregated carbon intensity data at a national level over time, including maximum, minimum, and average values. 'Statistic' mode also offers measures of carbon intensity, presenting a broad view of environmental performance and fluctuations.
3. **Factor Contribution Analysis**: 'Factor' mode examines the contribution of nine different factors to the UK’s carbon intensity over a specified period. It provides a detailed breakdown of each factor’s relative impact, helping users identify the primary contributors to carbon emissions.
4. **Localised Data by Postcode**: Targeted for more specific, localised insights, 'Region' mode allows users to input an outward postcode and a date to access data on the nine different factors affecting carbon intensity in that area, alongside forecasted values for the day. This facilitates localized environmental assessments and planning.



Overall, the app serves as a versatile tool for environmental monitoring and planning, catering to both general and specific user needs regarding the carbon footprint analysis in the UK.
